                        Welcome :wave:! I am Glenn Fung. I am a predoctoral research fellow at Northwestern University Kellogg School of Management. I hold an MA in economics from The University of Chicago, a B.S. with First-Class Honors in Applied Mathematics from The University of Birmingham, and a B.Econ. in Economics from Jinan University. My research applies deep learning and statistical learning methods to address behavioral issues of consumers, financial markets, measurements, matching, etc. I am particularly interested in using edge-cutting methods (machine learning, optimization, causal inference, game theory) in analyzing behavioral problems and in marketing applications.

            </section>
            <p>
                I love traveling! Here are some places I've been to: :cn: :hong_kong: :macau: :us: :singapore: :malaysia: :thailand: :united_arab_emirates: :australia: :new_zealand: :tr: :ru: :gb: :jp: :kr: :fr: :it: :switzerland: :vatican_city: :canada:. Exploring different cuisines around the world is one of my favorite things to do!
            </p>
            <p>
                I grew up in Guangzhou, a vibrant subtropical city in southern China near Hong Kong (if you look at the world map, you'll find it on the Tropic of Cancer), known for its amazing Cantonese cuisine (yes, dim sum!). These days, I live in the Greater Chicago area—a wonderful place in the U.S., if you don’t mind the occasional gust of strong wind.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before majoring in math, I was deeply interested in history—a passion I still hold onto through reading. More recently, I’ve become fascinated by physics beyond my formal studies. Physical models are just so powerful and elegant!
            </p>
            <p>
                I’m passionate about languages! I’m fluent in Mandarin, Cantonese, and English, and currently learning Spanish and Japanese. I also speak a bit of Korean. My name in my native Cantonese is Fung Tsz Yui. However, I prefer to go by Glenn. In Mandarin, my name is Feng Zirui, so you sometimes do see me using the last name Feng. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In my free time, I enjoy reading (both classical and modern works in Chinese and English), watching films from around the world, and playing video games (you’ll find me on Steam!). Some games I’ve enjoyed recently include Split Fiction, Don’t Starve Together, Fall Guys, It Takes Two, and Naraka: Bladepoint—gaming is always more fun with friends! I used to play the violin and piano (though not anymore), but I still love music from all over the world, especially in my native Cantonese.
