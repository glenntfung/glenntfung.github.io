Welcome 👋! I am Glenn Fung. I am an Empirical Research Fellow in Quantitative Marketing at Northwestern University Kellogg School of Management, working with Professor Artem Timoshenko.

I hold an M.A. in Economics from The University of Chicago, a B.S. in Applied Mathematics from the University of Birmingham, and a B.Econ. from Jinan University. I’ve contributed to projects at NUS, Chicago Booth, and Northwestern Kellogg that span large-language and vision models, causal-inference frameworks, and optimization algorithms.

My research blends methodological work—benchmarking and calibrating foundation models, designing deep structural causal networks for multi-modal experiments, and developing game-theoretic and RL approaches—with practical applications in marketing mix allocation and operational planning. I’ve worked on projects involving facial emotion analysis, person re-identification, survey-based Bayesian computations, financial econometrics, and survey statistical modeling. Building on this foundation, I plan to pursue a Ph.D. in marketing or operations to advance AI-driven decision science and bridge cutting-edge machine-learning models with real-world strategy.

Emails are the best way to reach me. I am also available for a chat via Zoom or in person if you are in the Greater Chicago area; [you can pick a timeslot here to chat](https://cal.com/glenn-fung-mqul3k/default).
