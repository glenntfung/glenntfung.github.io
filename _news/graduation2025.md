title: Graduating from UChicago
---

Today, I have officially graduated from The University of Chicago with a Master of Arts degree. I am deeply grateful to everyone who encouraged me along the way—family, friends, and teachers—and to the vibrant community at UChicago that made these past year so rewarding and amazing—couldn’t have done it without you! ❤️
