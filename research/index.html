  My research centers on applying machine learning and statistical methods, particularly deep learning, to address real-world behavioral and measurement issues across various domains, including financial markets, management, consumer behavior, human rights abuses, matching, and labor & education. I am particularly interested in using edge-cutting methods (machine learning, optimization, causal inference, game thoery) in analyzing behavioral problems and in marketing applications. My current projects involve constructing deep neural networks for pairwise comparison analysis and developing debiasing methods for performance evaluations using deep learning on video, audio, and textual data. I have also extensively explored consumer behavior through big data in marketing research and addressed measurement problems from both theoretical and applied perspectives. Additionally, I have applied Bayesian non-parametric methods to tackle societal issues, such as violence against women and girls. My work combines advanced quantitative methods to solve complex problems in economics, marketing, and social sciences.
